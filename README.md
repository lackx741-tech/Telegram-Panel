### 🌐 TelegramOS: the full platform at [**telegramos.orvteam.com**](https://telegramos.orvteam.com) <kbd>BETA</kbd>

A hosted platform that goes far beyond this panel:

- 🛒 **Ready-made & rentable accounts:** activate pre-warmed, aged Telegram accounts from a built-in marketplace, or bring your own.
- 🧩 **No-code visual bot builder:** design bots and multi-step automations with a drag-and-drop flow editor, no programming required.
- 🛡️ **Anti-ban built for scale:** safely operate large fleets of accounts, not just a handful.

## Overview

Telegram Panel is a self-hostable system for operating many Telegram accounts from one place. It exposes the **same feature set through three interfaces**, so you can pick whatever fits your workflow:

| Interface | Best for | Entry point |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| 🤖 **Telegram Bot** | Access from any device, on the go | `python main.py` |
| 🖥️ **Interactive CLI** | A menu-driven terminal UI on your server | `python interactive_cli.py` |
| ⚡ **Command CLI** | Scripting & automation | `python cli_main.py …` |

> ⚠️ **Planning to run more than a few accounts?** When you self-host this panel, every account connects through the **same server IP** and the **same device signature**. Telegram sees both the IP and the device fingerprint of each session, so all your accounts look like they share one machine. In practice, running **more than ~3 accounts** this way often gets them **rate-limited or banned**.
>
> **[TelegramOS](https://telegramos.orvteam.com)** is built to solve exactly this. Each account runs in its **own isolated, Windows-like environment** (a distinct device fingerprint per account) behind a **dedicated residential IP**, so every account looks like a real, independent device on a real connection and stays safe even at high account counts. It also includes a rentable-account marketplace and a no-code visual bot builder.

## Features

- **Account management:** add, enable/disable, and persist multiple accounts, with automatic recovery of saved sessions and detection/cleanup of revoked ones.
- **Message monitoring:** keyword-based filtering across all active accounts, with real-time forwarding to a designated channel and a per-user ignore list.
- **Bulk operations:** run an action across N accounts at once (reactions, poll votes, join/leave, block, private messages, and comments).
- **Individual operations:** target a single account for any of the same actions.
- **Statistics & reporting:** account health, groups per account, keyword overview, and status reports.
- **Resilient by design:** concurrency limits, FloodWait handling, graceful degradation, and structured logging.

## Quick Start

> Requires **Python 3.8+**, Telegram API credentials from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org/apps), and a bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/ItsOrv/Telegram-Panel.git
cd Telegram-Panel

# 2. Create an isolated environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Configure
cp env.example .env               # then edit .env (see below)

# 5. Run (choose one)
python main.py                    # Telegram bot
python interactive_cli.py         # Interactive terminal UI
python cli_main.py --help         # Command-line interface
```

Minimal `.env`:

```env
API_ID=your_api_id
API_HASH=your_api_hash
BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
ADMIN_ID=your_telegram_user_id
CHANNEL_ID=@your_channel          # optional, for message forwarding
```

---

## Configuration

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|:--------:|---------|-------------|
| `API_ID` | ✅ | — | Telegram API ID from my.telegram.org |
| `API_HASH` | ✅ | — | Telegram API Hash from my.telegram.org |
| `BOT_TOKEN` | ✅ | — | Bot token from @BotFather |
| `ADMIN_ID` | ✅ | — | Your Telegram user ID (only this user may control the bot) |
| `CHANNEL_ID` | ➖ | — | Channel ID/username for forwarded messages |
| `BOT_SESSION_NAME` | ➖ | `bot_session` | Bot session filename |
| `CLIENTS_JSON_PATH` | ➖ | `clients.json` | Path to the accounts/config file |
| `RATE_LIMIT_SLEEP` | ➖ | `60` | Rate-limit delay (seconds) |
| `GROUPS_BATCH_SIZE` | ➖ | `10` | Batch size for group scans |
| `GROUPS_UPDATE_SLEEP` | ➖ | `60` | Group update interval (seconds) |
| `REPORT_CHECK_BOT` | ➖ | — | Bot username/ID used for report-status checks |

Runtime state lives in **`clients.json`**: `TARGET_GROUPS`, `KEYWORDS`, `IGNORE_USERS`, `clients`, and `inactive_accounts`.

---

## Usage

### Telegram bot

```bash
python main.py
```

Send `/start` to your bot (only `ADMIN_ID` is authorized) and navigate the inline menu: **Account Management**, **Individual**, **Bulk**, **Monitor Mode**, and **Report Status**.

### Command-line examples

```bash
# List configured accounts
python cli_main.py list-accounts

# Add an account (interactive login)
python cli_main.py add-account +1234567890

# React with 5 accounts to a message
python cli_main.py bulk reaction 5 "https://t.me/c/123456/789" 👍

# Vote in a poll with a single account
python cli_main.py individual vote my_session "https://t.me/channel/42" 2
```

Built on [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon) with an `asyncio`-first design: a single event loop per CLI invocation, a bounded concurrency semaphore for bulk work, and lock-guarded shared state.

## Web Panel (Node.js + React)

Alongside the Python bot, the repository ships a full-stack web panel that ports
the same automation operations to Node.js using [GramJS](https://github.com/gram-js/gramjs).
It exposes every operation through a JWT-protected REST API and a dark-themed
React dashboard with sidebar navigation.

```
Telegram-Panel/
├── backend/                       # Express + better-sqlite3 + GramJS API
│   └── src/
│       ├── server.js              # App entry, route registration
│       ├── database/db.js         # SQLite schema (accounts, proxies, logs, settings, …)
│       ├── services/
│       │   ├── telegram.js        # TelegramService — reactions, votes, join/leave,
│       │   │                      #   block, private messages, comments, bulk wrapper
│       │   └── apiPool.js         # Round-robin API credential pool
│       ├── utils/parseTelegramLink.js  # Private / public / topic link parser
│       ├── middleware/auth.js     # JWT auth
│       └── routes/                # auth, accounts, audience, messages,
│                                  #   automation, proxies, analytics, settings
├── src/                           # React + TypeScript frontend
│   ├── App.tsx / pages/           # HashRouter routes, Login, Register, Dashboard
│   ├── services/api.ts            # Typed API client (grouped method objects)
│   └── components/dashboard/      # Overview, Automation, Proxies, Analytics,
│                                  #   Settings, Accounts, Audience, Messaging panels
└── build.mjs / tailwind.config.js # esbuild bundle + Tailwind CSS
```

**Run it:**

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
cp .env.example .env          # set TELEGRAM_API_ID / TELEGRAM_API_HASH and JWT_SECRET
npm install
npm start                     # http://localhost:4000

# Frontend (from the repo root, in another shell)
npm install
npm run build                 # outputs public/bundle.js + public/styles.css
# serve the public/ directory with any static file server
```

The automation endpoints accept either a single `accountId` or an `accountIds[]`
array for bulk runs. Bulk operations use bounded concurrency, per-account error
isolation, FloodWait handling, and revoked-session detection — mirroring the
Python `execute_bulk_operation`. Every attempt is recorded in the
`automation_logs` table and surfaced in the Automation → History tab and the
Analytics panel.

## Testing

```bash
pytest tests/                                   # run the suite
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html       # with coverage
```

---

## Security

- Never commit `.env` or `*.session` files; both are git-ignored by default.
- Only `ADMIN_ID` can control the bot; all other users are rejected.
- Keep session files secure and back them up; rotate credentials if exposed.
- Keep dependencies up to date for security patches.
